# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation platform built using **Django** and **Scikit-learn**, leveraging **cosine similarity** to suggest similar movies based on user input. The system fetches dynamic movie metadata from the **TMDB API** and presents it via a clean Bootstrap UI.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django, Python, Scikit-learn
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3
- **Deployment**: PythonAnywhere / Railway / Heroku *(based on what you used)*
- **API Integration**: TMDB (The Movie Database API)

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔍 **Content-Based Filtering** using cosine similarity on movie metadata
- 🎞️ **Dynamic movie data** including posters, overviews, and ratings fetched from TMDB API
- 🧠 Lightweight **ML model** (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer + cosine similarity)
- ⚡ **Fast and responsive UI** powered by Bootstrap
- 🛡️ **Secure backend** with environment-managed secrets for API access

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**: Movie metadata (genres, keywords, etc.) is vectorized using CountVectorizer.
2. **Similarity Matrix**: Cosine similarity is computed on these vectors.
3. **User Input**: A movie title is selected by the user.
4. **Recommendation Engine**: System returns top-N similar movies using precomputed similarity scores.
5. **API Fetching**: TMDB API is used to display posters and movie details dynamically.

## 💻 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-django.git
cd movie-recommendation-django
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add Your TMDB API Key
Create a `.env` file and add:
```env
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
```

### 5. Run the Server
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## 🌐 Deployment (Handled by Me)

- 🐍 Deployed the backend on [PythonAnywhere / Heroku / Railway] using a production-ready Django setup.
- ⚙️ Configured environment variables, static files, and WSGI entry points.
- 🔗 Integrated the TMDB API securely with key rotation in deployment settings.
- 🛠️ Used version control and Git for deployment pipeline (local ➝ remote).
